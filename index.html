                            alternate captain for the Toronto Maple Leafs</strong> of the National Hockey League. Born in San Ramon, California,
                            Matthews and his family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona when he was an infant. Matthews became the first player in modern

                            rookie record and becoming just the second rookie since the 2004&dash;05 lockout to reach the milestone (along with Alexander Ovechkin)&semi;
                            he is just the fourth teenager in league history to accomplish the feat.
